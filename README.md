During this hackathon, I was working with:

✔️ Mahdi Shirmohammadi can easily take the complex and demanding web development assignments under challenging deadlines;

✔️ Muskan Kapoor is fast-learned and detail-oriented web developer;

✔️ Alice Lee has great understanding the end-user experience and always tries to put herself in user's shoes;

✔️ Ahmed Shaaban is an open minded designer and does what is best for the team and the user experience.

✔️ Ivanna Ihekwoaba has sharp eye for design and solid understanding of user experience.

Our team provided a solution that ensures that the EA App is adopted by their current users and we came up with a feature called EA SharePlay.  
We developed and implemented EA SharePlay that allows members to record highlight clips from all their favourite games! Then, they can simply share the clips with friends or save it in a customized profile section.
